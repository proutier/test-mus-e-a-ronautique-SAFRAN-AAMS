3 – The Exhibition Hangar and the Villaroche Site

The aeronautical hangar that now houses the Safran Museum has quite a history! At the end of the gallery on the right, two large panels are displayed. Look at the left panel: it shows the hangar at its original location in Saint-Chamas, on the shores of the Étang de Berre, near Marseille. Built in 1932, it then housed the Gnome and Rhône seaplane pilot school.

On the right panel, look at the large map of France. In 1947, the hangar was dismantled and transported by waterway to Melun, then reassembled at its current location. There, SNECMA used it for flight testing of jet engines.

At the bottom left, a box recounts the history of the Villaroche airfield, located just a few hundred meters from the museum. Notice the middle map. It shows two runways, built by the Germans in the 1940s: the North-South // and East-West runways.

Above, the 1949 map shows the layout of the SNECMA technical and test center. Indeed, the State had authorized SNECMA to settle south of the main runway (constructors such as Dassault and Nord Aviation were already using the northern zone of this runway for their flight tests). The two black-and-white photos testify to this period, which lasted until 1970.

The most remarkable chapters of French jet aviation history were written on this site. It was here that Colonel Rozanoff, test pilot for Société des Avions Marcel Dassault, became the first Frenchman to break the sound barrier in horizontal flight. Villaroche was also the site for flight testing of all jet aircraft in the Dassault Mystère and Mirage series.

Behind you, a final panel retraces the complete history of the companies that make up Safran, their mergers, and their evolution to the present day.

Then turn left after this last panel to enter the aeronautical hangar and discover the engines.
