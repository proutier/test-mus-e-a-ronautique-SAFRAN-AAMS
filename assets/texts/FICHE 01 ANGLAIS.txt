1 – General Introduction

Welcome to the Safran Aeronautics and Space Museum. You are now visiting the museum of the world’s oldest aeronautical company, founded in 1905. Today, Safran is an international high-technology group and a leading equipment manufacturer in the fields of Aeronautics, Space, and Defense.

The museum was created in the 1980s by a team of volunteers, both active and retired employees of SNECMA (the French National Company for the Study and Construction of Aircraft Engines), Safran’s original company. These enthusiasts committed themselves to restoring historic engines in order to preserve and share the exceptional heritage of their company. United within the AAMS (Association of Friends of the Safran Museum), they are responsible for running the museum and enriching its collections.

The Safran Museum is the largest aircraft engine museum in the world. Throughout your visit, you will discover the birth of the Group and its evolution. You will encounter the pioneers of aviation and space exploration, as well as the men and women who, for more than a century, have contributed to the development of Safran’s engines and other aeronautical equipment.

Enjoy your visit.
